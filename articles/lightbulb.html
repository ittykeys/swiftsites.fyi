	Imagine if every light bulb in your home was using ten times more energy than needed, just because it could.
	<br>
	That would waste said energy, be more expensive and damage the environment.
	<br>
	For no reason.
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<strong>
	What happens:
	</strong>
	<li>
	Websites that are bloated use more server resources, more energy, more data (what about people on limited plans?), which is both costly and environmentally damaging.
	</li>
	<strong>
	What you do:
	</strong>
	<li>
	Optimize those light bulbs (your website code) so they only use as much energy as needed, making Everything more efficient.
	</li>
	<li>
	Stop being lazy. Like for this site, I've done a custom backend solution for articles and whatnot.
	</li>
	<li>
	Don't listen to everything PMs / POs and clients request.
	</li>
	<li>
	Swear to
	<a class='alink' href='https://pledge-of-the-computing-professional.org/' title='Go to The Pledge of The Computing Professional' aria-label='Go to The Pledge of The Computing Professional' target='_blank'>
	this pledge.
	</a>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>
	Result:
	</strong>
	<br>
	Lower costs, faster load times and a more sustainable web.
	<br>
	Compare for yourself between the good and bad examples
