	<p>
	Picture every light bulb in your home using ten times more energy than necessary, simply because it can.
	The result?
	<br>
	Wasted energy, higher electricity bills, and unnecessary harm to the environment.
	<br>
	For no good reason.
	<br>
	Now, apply this analogy to the digital world;
	<br>
	Bloated websites consume more server resources, energy, and data;
	<br>
	Creating a cascade of inefficiencies and bad user experiences.
	<br>
	Let’s break it down.
	<br>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<strong>
	The problem: Bloated websites are unsustainable
	</strong>
	<li>
	Energy consumption;
	<br>
	Websites require hosting, and hosting requires servers.
	Servers, in turn, consume electricity — often a mix of renewable and nonrenewable energy.
	A bloated website running inefficient code will multiply energy consumption.
	</li>
	<li>
	Cost implications;
	<br>
	More resources mean higher hosting costs.
	Bloated assets increase bandwidth use, what about people on limited data plans or slower connections?
	</li>
	<li>
	Environmental damage;
	<br>
	Every byte sent over the internet has a carbon footprint.
	Large-scale inefficiencies, multiplied across millions of websites, contribute to global environmental harm.
	</li>
	<li>
	User experience;
	<br>
	Slow-loading websites frustrate people.
	<a class='alink' href='https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/mobile-site-load-time-statistics/' title='Mobile site load time statistics - Think with Google' aria-label='Mobile site load time statistics - Think with Google' target='_blank'>
	Research
	</a>
	shows that 53% of people abandon a mobile site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load.
	Add to that the impact on accessibility for people in regions with limited connectivity.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<strong>
	The solution: Think like an engineer, not a salesperson
	</strong>
	<li>
	Audit your site;
	<br>
	Use tools like to identify performance bottlenecks.
	Check for unnecessary scripts, oversized / unnecessary images, and unused CSS or JavaScript.
	<br>
	Each byte counts and should have a Clear purpose.
	</li>
	<li>
	Optimize code;
	<br>
	Avoid frameworks when a simpler solution works.
	It's ok to re-invent the wheel sometimes.
	Reduce third-party dependencies; each one comes with its performance costs.
	<br>
	Don't listen to everything project managers and clients request.
	</li>
	<li>
	Challenge overengineering and feature-creep;
	<br>
	Does the feature add real value, or is it a "nice-to-have" gimmick?
	Push back on unnecessary complex interactions unless justified.
	Instead of building features just because someone asked for them, build purposefully.
	</li>
	<li>
	Stop being lazy;
	<br>
	While forementioned frameworks might make it easier for developers,
	many of them are bloated either on the backend or frontend.
	Often they are completely unnecessary.
	<br>
	After all, what is a developers job? Think about that for a second.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<strong>
	Why this all matters: Benefits go beyond just cost and performance
	</strong>
	<li>
	Sustainability;
	<br>
	A greener web helps mitigate climate change.
	</li>
	<li>
	Inclusion;
	<br>
	A lean site works better on low-end devices and poor connections.
	</li>
	<li>
	User satisfaction;
	<br>
	Faster sites lead to happier people, better SEO rankings and more conversions.
	</li>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Compare for yourself between the good and bad examples
	<a class='alink' href='sitelists' title='Go to the sitelists' aria-label='Go to the sitelists'>
	collected.
	</a>
	<br>
	It’s time to stop treating bloated websites as an acceptable byproduct of "modern development."
	<br>
	But also remember; “Don't let the pursuit of tomorrow diminish the joy of today”.
