	Imagine if every light bulb in your home was using ten times more energy than needed, just because it could.
	<br>
	That would waste said energy, cost money and damage the environment.
	</p>
	<ul>
	<strong>
	What happens:
	</strong>
	<li>
	Websites that are bloated use more server resources, more energy, more data (what about people on limited plans?), which is both costly and environmentally damaging.
	</li>
	<strong>
	What you do:
	</strong>
	<li>
	Optimize those light bulbs (your website code) so they only use as much energy as needed, making Everything more efficient.
	</li>
	<li>
	Stop being lazy.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<strong>
	Result:
	</strong>
	<br>
	Lower costs, faster load times and a more sustainable web.
